# Destriped-factal
I am gonna make this project 2 parted: server and client. 
The server is responsable for displaying the fractals and for destriputing the work load across all the connected clients (the renderfarm).

The program is ment to run on all platforms (mono on non-windows). Mac and raspberry pi 3 tested (mono 4.8)

Ps: Sorry for any unneeded dumping, my vs on mac is not woring right and the github desktop clients wants to include every file from here to the moon and back.
